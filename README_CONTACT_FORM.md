The contact form works immediately with mailto fallback - no setup required!

### Enable EmailJS (5 minutes)
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create account
2. Set up email service (Gmail recommended)
3. Create email template using provided template
4. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
5. Update `lib/emailjs.ts` with your credentials

That's it! Your contact form will then send emails directly.

## Template for EmailJS

Use this template structure in your EmailJS dashboard:

```
Subject: Portfolio Contact: {{subject}}

Hello Vodnala Srujana,

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
Sent from your portfolio contact form
```

## Security Notes

- âœ… Public key is safe to expose in client-side code
- âœ… No sensitive credentials in the codebase
- âœ… Service runs entirely on client-side
- âœ… Fallback ensures users can always contact you

## Troubleshooting

**Contact form not sending emails?**
1. Check `lib/emailjs.ts` configuration
2. Verify EmailJS dashboard settings
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Mailto fallback should always work
